# Unity Lab
Dockerised Unity installation

## Unity App Image
Download the Unity application installer from [here](https://public-cdn.cloud.unity3d.com/hub/prod/UnityHub.AppImage)

Place UnityHub.AppImage in the Docker build directory (important ensure it is called UnityHub.AppImage). The app will then be copied across to the container image during the build process.
